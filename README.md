# wine_dataset_classification_playground
I produced this jupyter notebook to apply some machine learning algorithms for classification purpose. 
I used it as a playground, to grow up my skills in applying different ML models, using a non-trivial problem. 
This is a simple but very well organize dataset, so the developer can focus more on the modelling phase, rather than on data cleaning and preprocessing phases, 
which are usually time consuming.

More easy-to-fit classifiers have been trained and compared their generalization capabilities.
